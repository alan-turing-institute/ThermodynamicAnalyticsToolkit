### test on reshuffling the dataset (after duplicating for steps)

# PROBLEM:
# A dataset is multiplicated (one copy for every step) and subsequently
# shuffled. If the dataset is small and the batch size equal to the dataset
# size, then non-unique values may arise per batch.
#
# This happens because the shuffling is not limited to each copy but extends
# over the whole multiplied dataset range.
#
# NOTE:
# This can be alleviated since introduction of tf.Dataset in TF1.4, where
# tf.Dataset.shuffle() and ..batch() replace tf.train.shuffle_batch().
# We modified the test to still illustrate the behavior.
