### test on tensorflow's global seed not reproducing results on slightly changed network

# PROBLEM:
# Although tensorflow offers setting a "global" seed, where different seeds
# for local operations are derived uniquely from this global seed. These local
# seeds depend on the internal enumeration of the nodes.
#
# If the graph is changed, e.g. by adding additional nodes, then this
# enumeration changes and therefore the random number seeds will change
# as well.
#
# Therefore, we cannot simply use the global seed to enforce reproducible
# runs for testing against stored output files. When the graph is changed,
# then this output will change as well.
