### test on tensorflow's numerical rounding inaccuracies on summation

# PROBLEM:
# If numbers are summed, then the limited floating point precision has an
# effect: The result may change on the order of summation. This is the
# general numerical rounding issue with floating point numbers, i.e. numpy
# has the same issue.
#
# We face this issue on summing up contributions to a global variable such
# as the kinetic_energy. As weights and biases per layer are independent
# of another, the order of summing their contribution is arbitrary.
