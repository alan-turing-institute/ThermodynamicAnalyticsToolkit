### test on tensorflow's concat op (on tf.Variable) not yielding something variable

# PROBLEM:
# It would be very convenient to rearrange the variables of the neural
# network. Variables are weights and biases and are each contained in
# different matrices, one per layer. If one could arrange all of them into
# a single vector/matrix, this would allow for easy evaluation and
# setting from a set of given values.
#
# Note that tensorflow does offer to store the model to file which includes
# all variables values as well. But the format is quite involved and does
# not all to easily extract the values themselves.
#
# One approach would be to use tf.concat and tf.stack to rearrange the
# variables. However, then the "variable" character is lost, i.e. they can
# no longer be set. This cases the error of "Tensor has now assign()".
