# Darwin needs some help in figuring out where non-installed libtool
# libraries are (on this platform libtool encodes the expected final
# path of dependent libraries in each library).

# .. is for the *.py files, and ../.libs for the *.so.  We used to
# rely on a module called ltihooks.py to teach the import function how
# to load a Libtool library, but it started to cause issues with
# Python 2.6.
