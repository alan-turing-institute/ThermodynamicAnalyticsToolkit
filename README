This is project with Ben Leimkuhler and Zofia Trstanova on the TensorFlow framework.

Ben sees with very simple data sets from TensorFlow's playground (playground.tensorflow.org)
that there are metastable regimes during the optimization.

He suggest that we should couple it with Bayesian sampling models, which Zofia
implemented in MatLab, and run lots of numerical experiments.
