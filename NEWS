v0.3
====

- added HamiltonianMonteCarlo sampler
- added BAOAB sampler
- parameters can be fixed in optimization or sampling (also loss function
  sampling)
- FIX: trajectories are now correctly written also for networks with hidden
  layers
- diffusion map analysis can now use python package pydiffmap (and is 
  recommended due to optimal epsilon choice)
- all cmdline examples in userguide are also fully tested
- added input space sampler to see classification boundaries of network
- we no longer generate datasets in memory but parse from CSV files
- added DatasetWriter to produce CSV for old in-memory datasets

v0.2
====

- enhanced userguide with fully tested python examples
- using double floating point precision by default
- allowed external setting of inter and intra ops thread number for 
  parallelizaton
- distributable tarball is working (make dist), target distcheck not yet
- added measuring of execution times (init, train, overall)
- FIX: batch_size went missing
- FIX: Dataset was not shuffled properly and split into test/train inconsistent
- added loss manifold sampler
- added Python interface
- added userguide
- added saving and restoring of neural network model to and from file.
- added trajectory analyser for average parameters and diffusion map analysis
  based on the contributed code by Zofia Trstanova
- added sampling of average kinetic energy and configurational temperature,
  accurate by accumulating in every step (not just "every_nth" step)
- added autotools testsuite
- added SGLD, Geometric Langevin Algorithm 1st and 2nd order sampling


v0.1
====

- gradient descent, SGD, and SGLD optimization
- datasets confined to ones from TensorFlow "playground"
- trajectory analyser
