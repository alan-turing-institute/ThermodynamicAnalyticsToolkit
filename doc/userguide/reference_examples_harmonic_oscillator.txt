Harmonic oscillator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It can be sometimes useful to use TATi to simulate a simple harmonic oscillator.
This model can be obtained by training the neural network with one parameter
on one point latexmath:[X=1] in dimension one with a label
equal to zero, i.e. latexmath:[Y=0], and using the mean square loss function and
linear activation function.
More precisely, the cost function becomes in this setting:

latexmath:[L(\omega | X,Y) = | \omega X + b - Y|^2],

where we fix the bias latexmath:[b=0].

The output trajectory in +trajectory_ho.csv+ or `weight0` is distributed w.r.t.
a Gaussian, i.e. the density of X:=weight0 is latexmath:[exp(-X^2)], see Figure
link:#reference_simulation_harmonic_oscillator.harmonic_oscillator[Gaussian distribution].

NOTE: The figure was obtained with setting `max_steps` to 10000.
