Style guide
===========

For the general user guide on asciidoc formatting, see 
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc

- Options are set like 'batch_data_files'.
- Filenames, executables, and paths are set like to +test.csv+.
- Functions and classes are set like `tati`.
- _emphasize_
- formulas: ++latexmath:[$a=b$]++ (do not use passthrough delimited block as
  these are not converted for the html output and only work in the pdf output).
  We are constrained (as we need to produce either output format) to 
  latexmathml, see http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/chunked/ch25.html
  Moreover, LatexMathML only has a simpler subset of all typical AMS or 
  special font latex  commands, e.g., there is no ++\tfrac++, ++\cal++, 
  ++\text++ and so on.
