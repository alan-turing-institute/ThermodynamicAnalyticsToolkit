***************************************
TATi is a software suite written in Python based on link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[tensorflow]'s
Python API. It brings advanced sampling methods (GLA1 and GLA2, BAOAB, HMC) to
_neural network training_. Its *tools* allow to assess the loss manifold's
topology that depends on the employed neural network and the dataset. Moreover,
its *simulation* module makes applying present sampling Python codes in the
context of neural networks easy and straight-forward. The goal of the software
is to enable the user to analyze and adapt the network employed for a specific
classification problem to best fit her or his needs.

TATi has received financial support from a seed funding grant and through a
Rutherford fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute in London (R-SIS-003,
R-RUT-001) and EPSRC grant no. EP/P006175/1 (Data Driven Coarse Graining using
Space-Time Diffusion Maps, B. Leimkuhler PI).
