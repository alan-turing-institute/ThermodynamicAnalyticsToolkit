Quickstart
----------

Before we come to actually using TATi, we explain what possible approaches
there are to sampling a high-dimensional function such as the loss manifold of
neural networks. To this end, we talk about grid-based sampling that however
suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality. Moreover, we will discuss Monte Carlo
and especially Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. In the latter category we have
what we will call dynamics-based sampling. This approach does not suffer in
principle from the Curse of Dimensionality but moreover may have additional
savings by looking only at areas of the manifold that have small loss.
At the end, want to set the stage with a little example: We will look  at a
very simple classification task and see how it is solved using neural networks.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

This has been the quickstart introduction.

In the following reference section you may find the following pieces
interesting after having gone through this quickstart tutorial.

- <<reference.examples.harmonic_oscillator>> for a light-weight example
  probability distribution function whose properties are well understood.
- <<reference.implementing_sampler>> explaining how to implement your own
  sampler using the `Simulation` module as rapid-prototyping framework.
- <<reference.simulation>> giving detailed examples on each function in
  `Simulations`'s interface'.
