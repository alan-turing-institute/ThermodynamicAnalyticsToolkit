***************************************
TATi is a software suite written in Python based on link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[tensorflow]'s
Python API. It brings advanced sampling methods (GLA1 and GLA2, BAOAB, HMC) to
_neural network training_. Its *tools* allow to assess the loss manifold's
topology that depends on the employed neural network and the dataset. Moreover,
its *simulation* module makes applying present sampling Python codes in the
context of neural networks easy and straight-forward. The goal of the software
is to enable the user to analyze and adapt the network employed for a specific
classification problem to best fit her or his needs.

TATi has received financial support from a seed funding grant and through a
Rutherford fellowship from the Alan Turing Institute in London (R-SIS-003,
R-RUT-001) and EPSRC grant no. EP/P006175/1 (Data Driven Coarse Graining using
Space-Time Diffusion Maps, B. Leimkuhler PI).

[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

Performing efficient neural network training or sampling requires many ingredients.
In this programmer's guide we would like to equip you with the necessary
knowledge of the abstract concepts and also we would like to show how to
extend link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[Tensorflow]'s capabilities with respect
to implementing sampling methodshow to do achieve the specific
implementation as it is done in TATi.

NOTE: In case you are generally unfamiliar with TATi, we would like to refer you to
the userguide that is also contained in the documentation of this package.

In detail, this guide will give introductory details on the inner workings and
major  concepts of tensorflow. Moreover, we give extensive details on what is
needed to perform neural network training using tensorflow including
implementation examples. We conclude with providing details on how tensorflow
was extended in order to allow for advanced sampling methods to be incorporated
in the course of TATi and how general programming concepts like local and
global variables, branching can be executed. This will allow you to build upon
this knowledge and extend TATi with your own ideas taking full advantage of
the Tensorflow performance.
